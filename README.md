# Craft-Alley
Craft Alley is a self-contained iOS application developed in SwiftUI. The app aims to serve as a space to showcase all local artists/designers who offer freelance services. The software seeks to make hiring and discovering freelancers easier by removing the need for users to do in-depth online searches.
