# Craft-Alley
Craft Alley is a self-contained iOS application developed in SwiftUI. The app aims to serve as a space to showcase all local artists/designers who offer freelance services. The software seeks to make hiring and discovering freelancers easier by removing the need for users to do in-depth online searches.

Users may easily browse various artists and designers through Craft Alley. They can decide which freelancer they want to hire for the job they require. Once a decision has been made, the user may get in touch with the artist directly using the supplied email address or another chosen manner.
